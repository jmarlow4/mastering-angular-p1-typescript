# Part 1 - TypeScript
## 1 - Why Typescript?

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that lets you "strongly type" your code and compiles to clean JavaScript.   
* You can use it AS NEEDED.
* Limit's JavaScript's "tyranny of freedom"
* Forces you to think about the kinds of values youâ€™re passing back and forth.
* The objective of TypeScript is to help you write better, easier, more maintainable code
