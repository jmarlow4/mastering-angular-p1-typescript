{
  // 1. Create an interface called Car with the following properties
  //  - numPassengers, typed to receive a number value

  // 2. Create an interface called Motorcycle with the following properties
  //  - hasSideCar, typed to receive a boolean
  //  - make (optional), typed to receive a string
  //  - model, typed to receive a string

  // 3. Create a function that...
  //  - receives a UNION type of Car and Motorcycle as it's only argument
  //  - logs the model to the console

  // 4. Make two function calls of that function (step 3)
  //  - pass in an object shaped like a "Car" with appropriate values
