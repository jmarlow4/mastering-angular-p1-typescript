{
  // 1. Create an interface called "Enemy" that has 2 members:
  //    - A string called "weapon"
  //    - A method that returns nothing called "attack"


  // 2. create a class called "Slime" that IMPLEMENTS the Enemy interface


    // 3. The Constructor should take in a private readonly parameter property
    //    called "_color" that's typed to receive a string and a private parameter
    //    property called "_weapon" that's also typed to receive a string


    // 4. Create a getter for the "_weapon" property called "weapon."
    //    This will satisfy the "weapon" member of the Enemy interface


    // 5. Implement the Enemy interface's "attack" member method. Have it log
    //    a sentence to the console that contains the values "_color" and
    //    "_weapon" properties
    //    example: "[color] slime strikes with it's [weapon]!"


  // 6. Create an instance of slime with a color and weapon of your choice and
  //    assign it to a const


  // 7. Invoke your new slime's "attack" method
